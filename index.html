			<p><b>The Bull Terrier</b>, also known as the <u>Bully</u> or <u>bully</u>, is a breed of terrier that was bred for dog fighting and as a guard dog. Since being successfully bred, the Bull Terrier has quickly conquered fastidious dog owners with its funny face, large egg-shaped head and lovely personality. Even so, the Bull Terrier is an exceptionally strong breed. The extremely sharp killer ability makes the Bull Terrier a dangerous dog for smaller animals.
				<br>
				<br>
				The Bull Terrier appeared in England in the 1830s by crossing the now-extinct English Bulldog and the now-extinct British White Terrier, in order to create a new breed of hunting dog that was more active and neat. During this time, when dogfights between Bulldogs and Bulls and Terriers were at the center of attention, lovers of the sport decided to create a new breed with the ability to attack. work faster and more lightning fast.
				<br>
				<br>
				By crossing the Bulldog with the Old English Terrier, adding a bit from the Spanish Pointer, they created the Bull Terrier. When this breed was first bred, it was also known as "Bully" or "the bully" but not the most talented fighters. Bun terriers are often kept as house dogs or herding dogs. Later, the small Bull Terrier breed was born, which is similar to the Bun terrier, except that it is smaller.
				<br>
				<br>
				In 1850, the white bun (nicknamed the White Cavalier) was created and quickly became fashionable among the aristocracy. They are used in guarding, guarding, hunting rats and tending livestock. The development of the Bun Terrier's coat color began with James Hinks creating a pure white and popular breed. However, there are also some birds with color patches on the head that are not accepted. When the breed reappeared later, they were more well received. Another breeder like Ted Lyon boldly crossed his white dogs with his former colored terriers. Since then, no more pure white bun.
				<br>
				<br>
				The Bun Terrier is not a Pit Bull is a breed used in competition when the Bull and Terrier were crossed, they are just related. However, the breed did not become the most successful fighters. Today, many Bull Terrier owners even refer to them as the English Bun Terrier to avoid confusion. Bully is famous for his strength, intelligence and bravery. But over the years, breeders have often focused on the Bull Terrier's personality rather than its aggressiveness. That is why this breed today is very friendly, obedient, loyal, and responsible.
				<br>
				<br>
				Health
				Deafness occurs in 20.4% of pure white Bull Terriers and 1.3% of colored Bull Terriers,[8] often being difficult to notice at a young age. Many Bull Terriers have a tendency to develop skin allergies.[9] Insect bites, such as those from fleas, and sometimes mosquitoes and mites, can produce a generalised allergic response of hives, rash, and itching. A UK breed survey puts their median lifespan at 10 years and their mean at 9 years (1 s.f., RSE = 13.87% 2 d. p.), with a good number of dogs living to 10–15 years.[10]

				History
				<br>
				<br>
				James Hinks Bull terrier
				A Bull Terrier circa 1915
				At the start of the 19th century, the "bull and terrier" breeds were developed to satisfy the needs for vermin control and animal-based blood sports. The bull and terriers were based on the Old English Bulldog (now extinct) and Old English Terriers with possible other terriers. This new breed combined the speed and dexterity of lightly built terriers with the dour tenacity of the Bulldog, which was a poor performer in most combat situations, having been bred almost exclusively for fighting bulls and bears tied to a post. Many breeders began to breed bulldogs with terriers, arguing that such a mixture enhances the quality of fighting. Despite the fact that a cross between a bulldog and a terrier was of high value, very little or nothing was done to preserve the breed in its original form. Due to the lack of breed standards—breeding was for performance, not appearance—the "bull and terrier" eventually divided into the ancestors of "Bull Terriers" and "Staffordshire Bull Terriers", both smaller and easier to handle than the progenitor.
				<br>
				<br>
				In the mid-19th century, James Hinks started breeding bull and terriers with "English White Terriers" (now extinct), looking for a cleaner appearance with better legs and nicer head. In 1862, Hinks entered a dam called "Puss" sired by his white Bulldog called "Madman" into the Bull Terrier Class at the dog show held at the Cremorne Gardens in Chelsea, London. Originally, these dogs did not yet have the now-familiar "egg face", but kept the stop in the skull profile.The dog was immediately popular and breeding continued, using Dalmatian, Spanish Pointer, and Whippet to increase elegance and agility; and Borzoi and Rough Collie to reduce the stop. Hinks wanted his dogs white, and bred specifically for this. The first modern Bull Terrier is now recognized as "Lord Gladiator", from 1917, being the first dog with no stop at all.
				<br>
				<br>
				Due to medical problems associated with all-white breeding, Ted Lyon among others began introducing color, using Stafford shire Bull Terriers in the early 20th century. Colored Bull Terriers were recognized as a separate variety (at least by the AKC) in 1936. Brindle is the preferred color, but other colors are welcome.[12][14]
				Along with conformation, specific behavior traits were sought.</p>
